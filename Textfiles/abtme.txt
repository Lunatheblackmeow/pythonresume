Although I graduated from Singapore Polytechnic with an Diploma in Accountancy,
My real passion lies in IT as I have been building my own computer systems since I am
in secondary school and playing around with IT gadgets such as wifi routers, range extenders, 
raspberry pi, etc.

I took a course in computer networking to get a formal certification in IT, but currently
I am focusing on developing myself into an front end web developer and is currently enrolled
in a 1 year part time diploma for web development, I plan to further my expertise in taking a
Specialized Diploma after completing the current qualification.
